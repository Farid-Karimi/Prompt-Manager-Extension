# Prompt Manager Extension 

So, I needed a way to quickly browse, search, and grab some ready-to-go prompts without copy-pasting from random docs every time. Then I found this awesome Hugging Face dataset full of prompts, and… well, I couldn’t resist coding up a quick Chrome extension for it.  

Now we’ve got a lightweight little tool that lets you:  
- Browse a big collection of prompts (straight from [this Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts))  
- Search and filter prompts on the fly  
- Pin your favorites so they’re always handy  
- Add and edit your own custom prompts when you need something special  

It’s all local, simple, and built just to make life easier when managing prompts.
